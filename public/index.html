                    <h2>What is it?</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-content">Unshrink is a place where you can grow your business. We offer a unique lead generation and cross-selling platform.</p>
                    <h2>What makes Unshrink so unique?</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-content">To start off we are friendly, open and honest. We don’t force leads on you that you do not want, like other lead generation companies – you get to choose your own leads by viewing a short description of the lead before you click to buy it. We think this is fairer.</p><p class="smaller-content">But there’s not just that, there’s stacks more. Like the fact you get to see how many people have bought the lead before you buy it and asking our members to let us know that they have won a lead so we can take it off the system. We qualify all leads over the phone before passing them onto you too – we value quality over quantity. The most important thing to us is providing an awesome service to our customers that they value.</p>
                    <h2>How do you get your leads?</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-content">We will be launching search engine optimised websites, mobile apps, sponsored blogs and more but our key feature is a platform for other people (you!) to provide leads. We have tools for you to do this instantly and also an API available for you to use in your own websites, software or apps. The possibilities are endless and you can start making a profit pretty much instantly.</p>
                    <h2>Who's it for?</h2>
                   <p class="smaller-content">Unshrink is for both agencies and freelancers specialising in: web development, web design, graphic design, programming, mobile (iPhone, Android, Blackberry) development, RIA development, video production, seo, print design, embedded systems, game development, viral marketing, PR and e-learning. We plan to roll out to many more industries in the future.</p><p>
Any questions or suggestions? Contact us at <a href="mailto:launch@unshrink.net">launch@unshrink.net</a> – we’re listening.</p>

                <div  class="content-link">
                    <h2>How much does it cost to join?</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-content">Nothing. Nada. It’s free to join and browse the leads and use the API or tools (in fact we’ll pay you for that – more below). If you want to buy a lead just buy some credits and buy the lead.</p>
                    <h2>How much do the leads cost?</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-content">This is another thing we do differently here. A lead’s price reduces over time. Every 20 minutes a lead’s value will drop by a fiver – meaning you can get each lead for £5 if you are willing to wait – providing it doesn’t get snapped up before then. All leads start at £30 and can have a maximum of 6 people buying them. The sooner you buy the more likely you are to get the business from the lead, hence the difference in price – but if you hold out you might get an absolute bargain.</p>
                    <h2>How much can I earn providing leads?</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-content">We split revenue from leads you supply 50/50. We’ll either send you a cheque at the end of each month or transfer to your bank – whichever you prefer. There is no minimum amount to earn before we pay up.</p>
                    <h2>What's this cross-selling about?</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-content">The cross-selling tools and API allow you to easily make a profit by enabling you to offer your current clients more services. You can do this by supplying them with free quotes and advice from similar (but not the same) professions as yours. This means you could earn up to £90 for each other service your client is interested in. So if your client was interested in three other services that we offer you could earn £270 for simply providing your client with a quality service.</p>
                    <h2>What tools will be available on launch?</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-content">The first cross-selling tool we offer will be a web portal with a unique personalised URL. You can set-up and customise this portal by just ticking a few boxes which takes under a minute.</p>
